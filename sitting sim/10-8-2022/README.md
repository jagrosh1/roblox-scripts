# Sitting Simulator GUI
Thank you for using this sitting simulator script, it's new and I will occasionally commit to the loader.lua file! If you experience any issues or would like to make a suggestion you can submit it **here** *or contact me* **via Discord.** Hope this script can help a lot, if you are the game owner & try patching these I will unpatch it.

## Functions
* **Turkey Spam** - *Rapidly resets your character while dropping turkeys.* **(may cause lag to others)**
* **Sword Bot** - *Decent Swordfighting bot with some precautions to staying alive.* (**works best with reach**)
* **Sword Reach** - *Loads the modified Woot Reach script.*
* **Orb Farm** - *Brings your character to orbs.* (**with basically god mode, as long as you don't interact with your character/tools**)

* Ideas for Function Modification: 
    * **Sword Bot** - Be properly seated on the chair when no target occurs

## UI Functions
* **Draggability** - *Right-click on the mouse to drag the ui*
* **Shutdown UI** - *Drag the UI to the bottom-right screen to cleanup the running code & UI*

## Script/Setup Initialization [Finally]
Run this code in your executor & you will get the latest updated version of this project. **(You can put it in auto-execute!)**
```lua
task.wait(3)
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jagrosh1/roblox-scripts/main/sitting%20sim/10-8-2022/loader.lua",true))()
```

## Final Notes [Disclaimer]
You can get banned **(in-game; not Roblox)** & will most likely get banned from using these functions as people from the community will report you to the game developer. I highly suggest you keep it on the down-low, try staying away from high-ranked/high points-kills players & discord boosters/group members or users who claim they will report you!
